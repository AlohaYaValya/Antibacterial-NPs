# Data-Driven-Engineering---Project
The project aims to develop a service for designing the selectively cytotoxic inorganic nanomaterials with antimicrobial properties. We are planning to combine an evolutionary method with a machine learning approach in order to achieve the best properties of antimicrobial nanoparticles.
